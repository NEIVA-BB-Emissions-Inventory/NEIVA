## Next Gen Emissions Inventory expansion of Akagi (NEIVA) version 1.0

### Welcome to NEIVA inventory!

NEIVA is a biomass burning emissions inventory that includes data files, database design codes, and tools. We recommend emission factors (EF) and provide essential property data relevant to atmospheric modeling. Additionally, we map chemical compounds to model surrogates, making it easier to use in modeling. The database is reproducible, and we offer programs for data integration, data processing steps. These programs can seamlessly incorporate new data with minimal human review needed in the process.
